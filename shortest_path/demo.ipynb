    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the [RAPTOR algorithm](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/raptor_alenex.pdf) researched at Microsoft for finding the earliest trip in a transit schedule. While it wasn't possible to replicate the exact algorithm, the idea is the same. \n",

    "Basic Algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the origin with `Earliest Arrival Time` to 0 for round 1, and `inifinity` for all other stops\n",
    "2. Initialize the improved boolean to True for origin and False for all others\n",
    "3. Start a loop from `0` to `max_transfers`\n",
    "   1. Find all the improved stops from the previous `round`\n",
    "   2. For each route from the improved stops find the trips that can occur in the current number of transfers\n",
    "   3. For each stop in that trip, check how long it takes to arrive and compare it with a previous arrival time, if any\n",
    "   4. For each stop in that trip, check if another stop is close enough to walk to and if the arrival time is faster that way\n",
    "   5. Store the parent trips and the round where improvement last occured\n",
    "   6. Increment the number of transfers and repeat the process\n",
    "4. Use all the stored information to rebuild the path for the destination by looping backwards from it\n"
